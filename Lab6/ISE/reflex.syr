The following registers are absorbed into counter <counter>: 1 register on signal <counter>.
	Found pipelined multiplier on signal <n0124>:
		- 1 pipeline level(s) found in a register connected to the multiplier macro output.
		Pushing register(s) into the multiplier macro.
INFO:Xst:3218 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM <Mram_cathodes> will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.
